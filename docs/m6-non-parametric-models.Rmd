# Module 6 Overview

While a large number of models can be expressed as parametric models, 
a big problem with them is that they require knowing or making an assumption about the “correct” model. 
Non-parametric statistics allow us to avoid some of these assumptions. 
We talk about how the types of nonparametric models work and the intuition behind them. 
We also talk about what assumptions we avoid and what we don’t.

# 6.1 Local Regression

K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric model that is used for regression and classification.
